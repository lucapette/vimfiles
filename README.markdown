My [Vim](http://www.vim.org) configuration directory.

**Do not use** my configuration. Read it to learn something, to get inspired.
But, please, build your own configuration. Read [Lazy Modern
Configuration](http://lucapette.com/vim/rails/vim-for-rails-developers-lazy-modern-configuration/)
to better understand what I mean.

I'm continuously adding comments to all the files.

Plugins
-------

- [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

  This is a wonderful plugin for handling your configuration. If you don't
  use it you should.

- [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
  If you use git you **must** learn to use this plugin.
  [Drew Neil](https://github.com/nelstrom) has done a great series of
  [screencasts](http://vimcasts.org/) about it.

- [ctrlp.vim](http://kien.github.com/ctrlp.vim/)
  It's the best fuzzy file finder ever. It has a lot of unique and crazy
  feature. I tried a lot of them and this is the best one. Period.

- [NERDTree](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658)
  You know this one. And if you don't know it, go straight to try it.

- [rails.vim](http://rails.vim.tpope.net/)

  I love rails and I love Vim. Someone would say I love tpope. But everyone
  loves tpope. BTW, this plugin is essential if you are a Rails developer.

- [snipMate](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate)

  This plugin tries to implement some features of the snippet feature of
  Textmate. I use it very often, you will.

- [Ack.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2572)

  This plugin is the Vim interface to [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/). I
  recommend to get the latest version of ack from the website.

- [vim-smartword](https://github.com/kana/vim-smartword)

  It provides word motions that are smarter in some sense. It's a little
  nice plugin.

- [codepath](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3435)

  I personally wrote this one and I use it to get the current project
  directory based on the assumption that all your projects are under the
  same *code* path.

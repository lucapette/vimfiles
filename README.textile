My vim configuration files

This repository includes my vim files, it also contains a _Rakefile_ for
syncing files. Sooner or later, I'll describe rake tasks.


h2. plugins

I currently use the following plugins:

* pathogen
This is a wonderful plugin for handling your configuration. If you don't use
it you should. Check it out at "https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen":https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen.
* FuzzyFinder and FuzzyFinderTextmate
These plugins try to emulate cmd-t feature in textmate. There are many options
out there, as command-t and PeepOpen but I still prefer this one. If you want
do dig into this solution please take a look at
"this":http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/10/10/coming-home-to-vim article.
* NERDTree
This is a very famous plugins and provides a very nice tree filesystem tree. Check
it out "here":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658.
* codepath
I personally wrote this one and I use it to get the current project directory
based on the assumption that all your projects are under the same _code_ path.
* rails.vim
I love rails and I love vim. Someone would say I love tpope. But everyone
loves tpope. BTW, this plugin is essential.
* snipMate
This plugin tries to implement some features of the snippet feature of
Textmate. I use it very often, you will. Check it out
"here":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540.
* textile
I use textile for many things and I was in need for a bit of syntax and a
simple preview. This plugin does exactly that. Check it out
"here":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2305.

h2. Roadmap

* add all the plugins used
* reorganize snippets.
* write documentation for configurations.

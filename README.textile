My vim configuration files

This repository includes my vim files, it also contains a _Rakefile_ for
syncing files. Sooner or later, I'll describe rake tasks.

h2. plugins

I currently use the following plugins:

* "pathogen":https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
This is a wonderful plugin for handling your configuration. If you don't use
it you should.
* FuzzyFinder and FuzzyFinderTextmate
These plugins try to emulate cmd-t feature in textmate. There are many options
out there, as command-t and PeepOpen but I still prefer this one. If you want
to dig into this solution please take a look at "this":http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/10/10/coming-home-to-vim article.
* "NERDTree":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658
This is a very famous plugins and provides a very nice tree filesystem tree.
* "codepath":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3435
I personally wrote this one and I use it to get the current project directory
based on the assumption that all your projects are under the same _code_ path.
* "rails.vim":http://rails.vim.tpope.net/
I love rails and I love vim. Someone would say I love tpope. But everyone
loves tpope. BTW, this plugin is essential.
* "snipMate":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540
This plugin tries to implement some features of the snippet feature of
Textmate. I use it very often, you will.
* "textile":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2305
I use textile for many things and I was in need for a bit of syntax and a
simple preview. This plugin does exactly that.
* "Ack.vim":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2572
This plugin is just an interface to "ack":http://betterthangrep.com/. I
recommend to install ack from the site.

h2. Rake tasks

"Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org/ is the ruby version of make. This project
contains the followibng tasks:

* bundles
It is run by the install task in order to initialize all the git bundles.
* install
It copies all the project files into your home directory.
* pull
It updates the project from git repo.
* update
It pulls from the repo and then installs the files in your home directory.

The install task is the default one.

h2. Roadmap

* add all the plugins used
* reorganize snippets.
* write documentation for configurations.

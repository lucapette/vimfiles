My vim configuration files

This repository includes my vim files, it also contains a _Rakefile_ for syncing files with your vim configuration directory.

h2. plugins

I use the following plugins:

* "pathogen":https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
This is a wonderful plugin for handling your configuration. If you don't use it you should.
* "command-t":https://wincent.com/products/command-t
Citing homepage _The Command-T plug-in for VIM provides an extremely fast, intuitive mechanism for opening files with a minimal number of keystrokes_. Believe him, it's really fast!
* "NERDTree":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658
This is a very famous plugins and provides a very nice tree filesystem tree.
* "codepath":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3435
I personally wrote this one and I use it to get the current project directory based on the assumption that all your projects are under the same _code_ path.
* "rails.vim":http://rails.vim.tpope.net/
I love rails and I love vim. Someone would say I love tpope. But everyone loves tpope. BTW, this plugin is essential if you are a Rails developer.
* "snipMate":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540
This plugin tries to implement some features of the snippet feature of Textmate. I use it very often, you will.
* "Ack.vim":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2572
This plugin is just an interface to "ack":http://betterthangrep.com/. I recommend to get the latest version of ack on the website.

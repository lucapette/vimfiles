# Acknowledgements

I'm really thankful to [Bram Moolenaar](http://www.moolenaar.net/) for his
generous work on the best editor ever. And I want to thank
[tpope](http://tpo.pe/) too. Without his incredible amount of work, I wouldn't
be able to use Vim everyday.

# Do not use a Vim distro

**Do not use my configuration** and please **do not use a Vim distro**. Read
the source code to learn something new and to get inspired. Don't hesitate to
contact me for any further information but, please, build your own
configuration. Read [Lazy Modern
Configuration](http://lucapette.me/vim-for-rails-developers-lazy-modern-configuration/)
to better understand what I mean. Of course, **steal whatever you like**.

Acknowledgements
----------------

I'm really thankful to [Bram Moolenaar](http://www.moolenaar.net/) for his
generous work on the best editor ever. And I want to say thank you to
[tpope](http://tpo.pe/) too. Without his incredible amount of work, I would
have been using some crappy editor out there.

Do not use a Vim distro
-----------------------

**Do not use my configuration** and please **do not use a Vim distro**. Read
the files to learn something and to get inspired. Don't hesitate to contact me
for any further information but, please, build your own configuration. Read
[Lazy Modern
Configuration](http://lucapette.me/vim-for-rails-developers-lazy-modern-configuration/)
to better understand what I mean. Of course, **steal whatever you like**.

I'm a Ruby developer and for this very reason my configuration has a lot of
stuff for Ruby and Rails. Lately I got interested in go so there may be go
related configuration here and there.
